# ESP32-Internet-Radio-Streamer-using-I2S-and-MP3-Decoder
This project transforms your ESP32 into an Internet Radio streamer that plays MP3 audio streams over WiFi in real-time using the I2S protocol. It connects to a live internet radio stream (e.g., Radio Paradise, SomaFM) and sends high-quality audio output to an external DAC or amplifier like the MAX98357A.
